The vendored folder is that commit's lab folder, unchanged, without its Git history.

`app/Dockerfile` (the lab's own) builds the machine as is: `docker: { build: app }`. Its base image `alpine:3.7` is pinned by tag, and its Python dependencies by version in `requirements.txt`.

To update, replace the vendored folder with a newer SKF labs commit, then change this file.
